## Design stage planning

## Design Thinking

---

---

### Empathize:

- as a user i want to be able to streamline my shopping, cooking and meal prep workflow and reduce food waste to save myself time, money and effort.
- i need the software i use to do this to be simple and efficient reducing the complexity of the above workflow, not adding complexity.
- I want to be able to get a quick but detailed overview of all stages of the process with no friction so i can spend the minimal amount of needed to see the relevant info i need and to crud this info effortlessly.

---

### Questions:

- what will keep users coming back to engage with site and make it part of their daily life?
- how can we make the site as smooth as possible for the user to achieve the desired result?
- how can we flesh out features of the site to offer optional additional services to the user if they want more content and tools to manage there food workflow? (recipe suggestions, user shared content etc)

---

### Examine:

- If i was a user i would like to be able to manage crud functionality intuitively with no bloated features.
- I would like to be able to see all the info I need at a glance for example while shopping or in the middle of a meal shopping lists and recipes should be accessible in seconds with a clear UI to achieve this.
- some additional features such as recipe suggestions from my ingredients in stock, other users recipes and customization features would be beneficial once they do not bloat the core functionality and add extra steps to time sensitive actions.
